The constructor method is a name __init__, and it is automatically called whena new instance of a class is created.\n","          class Person:\n","            def __init__(self, name, age):\n","                self.name = name\n","                self.age = age\n","\n","10)What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - In Pyhton, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that are not bound to instances of a class but to the class itself. Ther are degined using decorators, @classmethod and @staticmethod.\n","  - Class methods are the methods that receives the class as its first argument instead of the instance(self).\n","              class Employee:\n","              company = \"Kantar\"\n","\n","              def __init__(self, name):\n","                  self.name = name\n","\n","              @classmethod\n","              def change_company(cls, new_name):\n","                  cls.company = new_name\n","  - Static methods are the methods in Pythin which does not receive either self or cls. It behaves like a regular fucntion but belongs to the class's namespace.\n","          class MathUtils:\n","          @staticmethod\n","          def add(x, y):\n","              return x + y\n","\n","11) What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters(number or type). Python does not support tradiitonal method overloading. However to achieve this Pyhton uses:\n","      - Default Argument: You can simulate overloading by using default values for parameters.\n","              \n","              class Greet:\n","              def hello(self, name=None):\n","              if name:\n","                  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n","              else:\n","                  print(\"Hello!\")\n","\n","                    g = Greet()\n","                    g.hello()         # Output: Hello!\n","                    g.hello(\"Sonu\")  # Output: Hello, Sonu!\n","      \n","      - Variable-Length Arguments (*args, **kwargs):This allows a method to accept any number of arguments.\n","\n","                      class Calculator:\n","                  def add(self, *args):\n","                      return sum(args)\n","\n","                  c = Calculator()\n","              print(c.add(2, 3))         # Output: 5\n","              print(c.add(1, 2, 3, 4))   # Output: 10\n","\n","12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  - Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n","      - The method in the child class must have the same name, parameters, and return type as in the parent class.\n","      - It enables runtime polymorphism.\n","      - The overridden method in the child class replaces the parent class’s version when called on a child object.\n","\n","13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - The property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods that can be accessed like attributes, without explicitly calling them as functions. It’s part of Python’s descriptor protocol, which allows you to manage how attributes are accessed and modified.\n","\n","14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or behaviors).\n","  - Properties of polymorphism:\n","      - Code Reusability\n","      - We can add new classes without changing existing code, as long as they follow the expected interface.\n","      - Polymorphism allows us to manage complexity by abstracting behavior. You can update or extend functionality without affecting the rest of the system.\n","      - At runtime, the correct method is called based on the object's actual class, not the reference type.\n","\n","15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods—methods that are declared but contain no implementation. Subclasses must implement these methods.\n","\n","16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  - Object-Oriented Programming offers several key benefits that make it a popular paradigm for building scalable, maintainable, and reusable software systems:\n","      - Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and understand. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior.\n","      - Classes can be reused across different programs.Inheritance allows new classes to reuse existing code, reducing duplication.\n","      - OOP makes it easier to scale applications by adding new classes and features without affecting existing code.\n","      - Encapsulation helps isolate changes to specific parts of the code. Bugs are easier to locate and fix due to the modular structure.\n","      - Complex systems can be simplified by exposing only essential features and hiding implementation details.Promotes cleaner and more intuitive interfaces.\n","      - Protects internal object state by restricting direct access to data.Encourages use of getter/setter methods for controlled access.\n","      -Enables objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. Supports flexible and dynamic method invocation.\n","      - Facilitates hierarchical classification and code reuse. Allows new functionality to be built on top of existing code.\n","\n","17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  - Class Variable:\n","    - Shared across all instances of a class. Defined inside the class, but outside any instance methods.\n","    - Used for common properties that should be the same for every object.\n","  - Instance Variable\n","    - Unique to each instance of the class. Defined inside the constructor (__init__) or other instance methods using self.\n","    - Used for individual object properties.\n","\n","18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n"," - Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to access attributes and methods from all its parent classes.\n","              class Father:\n","              def skills(self):\n","                  print(\"Gardening, Carpentry\")\n","\n","          class Mother:\n","              def skills(self):\n","                  print(\"Cooking, Painting\")\n","\n","          class Child(Father, Mother):\n","              def skills(self):\n","                  super().skills()\n","                  print(\"Python Programming\")\n","\n","          c = Child()\n","          c.skills()\n","          # Output:\n","          # Gardening, Carpentry\n","          # Python Programming\n","\n","\n","19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","  - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special (dunder) methods used to define how objects are represented as strings. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n","  - __str__ → User-Friendly Representation:\n","    - Called by the str() function and print() statements.\n","    - Intended to return a readable, informal string representation of the object.\n","    - Useful for end users.\n","                      class Book:\n","                  def __init__(self, title):\n","                      self.title = title\n","\n","                  def __str__(self):\n","                      return f\"Book: {self.title}\"\n","\n","              b = Book(\"Python Basics\")\n","              print(b)  # Output: Book: Python Basics\n","  -__repr__ → Developer-Friendly Representation:\n","    - Called by the repr() function and in the interactive interpreter.\n","    - Intended to return a precise, unambiguous string that could be used to recreate the object.\n","    - Useful for debugging and development.\n","              class Book:\n","                def __init__(self, title):\n","                    self.title = title\n","\n","                def __repr__(self):\n","                    return f\"Book('{self.title}')\"\n","\n","            b = Book(\"Python Basics\")\n","            print(repr(b))  # Output: Book('Python Basics')\n","\n","20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","  - The super() function in Python is a built-in function that is used to give access to methods from a parent or sibling class. It is most commonly used in inheritance scenarios, especially when working with multiple inheritance or method overriding.\n","            class Animal:\n","              def speak(self):\n","                  print(\"Animal speaks\")\n","\n","          class Dog(Animal):\n","              def speak(self):\n","                  super().speak()  # Calls Animal's speak method\n","                  print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n","          dog = Dog()\n","          dog.speak()\n","\n","21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, which typically happens when there are no more references to the object.\n","    - Resource Cleanup:\n","      - It allows you to define cleanup behavior, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or freeing up other external resources.\n","    - Finalization Logic:\n","      - You can use it to log or perform final actions before an object is removed from memory.\n","    - Automatic Invocation:\n","      - Python automatically calls __del__ when the object’s reference count drops to zero (i.e., when it's no longer in use).\n","\n","22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods inside a class that are not instance methods, but they serve different purposes and behave differently.\n","\n","  - @staticmethod:\n","      - Does not take self or cls as the first argument.\n","      - Behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n","      - Cannot access or modify class or instance state.\n","      - Used when the method logic is related to the class but doesn't need to access class or instance data.\n","              class MathUtils:\n","                      @staticmethod\n","                      def add(x, y):\n","                          return x + y\n","\n","                  print(MathUtils.add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n","\n","    - @classmethod\n","      - Takes cls as the first argument, referring to the class itself.\n","      - Can access and modify class state that applies across all instances.\n","      - Often used for factory methods that create instances in different ways.\n","                  class Person:\n","                species = \"Human\"\n","\n","                def __init__(self, name):\n","                    self.name = name\n","\n","                @classmethod\n","                def from_string(cls, name_str):\n","                    return cls(name_str)\n","\n","            p = Person.from_string(\"Alice\")\n","            print(p.name)  # Output: Alice\n","\n","23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - Polymorphism in Python, especially with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables method overriding and dynamic method resolution, which are key to writing flexible and extensible code.\n","  - How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance\n","Method Overriding:\n","    - A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n","    - When we call the method on an instance of the subclass, Python uses the subclass’s version.\n","\n","  - Dynamic Dispatch:\n","    - Python determines which method to call at runtime based on the object’s actual type, not the reference type.\n","  - Common Interface:\n","    - You can write code that works on the superclass type, but it will behave correctly for any subclass.\n","              class Animal:\n","              def speak(self):\n","                  print(\"Animal speaks\")\n","\n","          class Dog(Animal):\n","              def speak(self):\n","                  print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n","          class Cat(Animal):\n","              def speak(self):\n","                  print(\"Cat meows\")\n","\n","          # Polymorphic behavior\n","          def make_animal_speak(animal):\n","              animal.speak()\n","\n","          animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n","          for a in animals:\n","              make_animal_speak(a)\n","\n"," 24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method chaining in Python object-oriented programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on the same instance.\n","      - Improves readability: Code becomes more concise and expressive.\n","      - Encourages fluent interfaces: Makes APIs easier to use and understand.\n","      - Reduces boilerplate: Avoids repetitive variable assignments.\n","\n","25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method in Python is a special (magic) method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This means you can use parentheses () after an object to invoke its __call__ method.\n","    - Function-like Behavior:\n","      - Makes objects behave like functions.\n","      - Useful for creating callable objects, especially in scenarios like decorators, function wrappers, or custom logic encapsulation.\n","\n","    - Encapsulation:\n","      - Allows to encapsulate behavior inside an object while still using it like a function.\n","    \n","    - Stateful Functions:\n","      - Enables maintaining internal state across calls, unlike regular functions."],"metadata":{"id":"BZwBqMpv5k14"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"3ixnlavdOEnF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1) Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message.
